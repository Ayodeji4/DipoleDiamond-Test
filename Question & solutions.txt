QUESTIONS 
1.Given an input array of numbers arranged in (any number of) rows and columns, write 
a function to find any element in the array that is zero, and then replace the entire row 
and column where that zero is located with zeros. 
 
Example 
1 2 3 4 
5 6 7 8 
9 10 0 11 
12 13 14 15 
Output 
  1 2 0 4 
  5 6 0 8 
  0 0 0 0 
12 13 0 15 

 Solution
-----------
let replaceRowCol = (matrix, trg=0, val=0) => {
  
  // Store width and height of matrix
  let w = matrix.length;
  let h = matrix[0].length;
  
  // A linked list
  let replaceX = new Set();
  let replaceY = new Set();
  
  // Any coord whose value is `trg` results in a replacement at that coord
  for (let x = 0; x < w; x++) { for (let y = 0; y < h; y++) {
    if (matrix[x][y] === trg) {
      replaceX.add(x);
      replaceY.add(y);
    }
  }}
  
  // Perform all replacements
  for (let x of replaceX) for (let y = 0; y < h; y++) matrix[x][y] = val;
  for (let y of replaceY) for (let x = 0; x < w; x++) matrix[x][y] = val;
  
  return matrix;
  
};

let matrix = replaceRowCol([
  [ 0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ],
  [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ],
  [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ],
  [ 1, 2, 3, 0, 5, 6 ],
  [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ]
]);

for (let row of matrix) console.log(row.join(' '));
 


3.Given an array of 0's and 1's, write a function to find the maximum consecutive 1's in 
the input array. 
 
Examples 
For 11000010001 the output is 1 i.e. Maximum number of consecutive 1's is 1 
For 00110001001110 the output is 3 i.e. Maximum number of consecutive 1's is 3 
writer.editor.GO_TO_TOP

Solution
------------
var findMaxConsecutiveOnes = function(nums) {
    let largestCount = 0;
    let currentCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i<nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 0) {
            currentCount = 0;
        } else {
            currentCount++;
        };
        if (currentCount > largestCount) largestCount = currentCount;
    };
    return largestCount;
};
